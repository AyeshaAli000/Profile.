🌟 *New Project: Stylish Profile Box* 🌟

I recently created a sleek and modern profile box using HTML and CSS. This component is designed to showcase personal information and social media links in a visually appealing manner.

### ✨ *Features:*
- *Profile Picture Display*: A circular profile picture at the top for a personal touch.
- *Name and Title*: Prominently displays the user's name and title (e.g., "Frontend Developer").
- *Social Media Links*: Easy-to-access buttons for Instagram, Twitter, and GitHub, styled for consistency and appeal.
- *Responsive Design*: Ensures a great look and feel on all devices.

### 💡 *Technology Stack:*
- *HTML*: Structured the content effectively.
- *CSS*: Applied modern styling techniques, including rounded corners and hover effects, to enhance user experience.

### 🛠️ *How It Works:*
- The profile box is designed to be simple yet elegant, making it perfect for personal websites or portfolios.
- Each social media button includes icons and hover effects to improve interactivity.

I’m excited to share this project with you all! Feel free to check it out and let me know your thoughts.
